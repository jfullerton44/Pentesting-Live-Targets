# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: XSS
 I found this vunerability by posting a XSS attack form in the contact form of each page and for the green page an XSS attack occured when the admin logged in and viewed the feedback page.

Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration
This vunerability was found because when the user entered a username that was not registed the "log in was unsuccessful" text was normal, but if the username was resgistered the text would be in bold.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Refrence (IDOR)
    Upon visiting the page for a specific salesperson you can see in the URL bar the parameter for "id". By changing this value you can visit any of the other salesperson's pages. In this case, I was able to find the page of a salesperson that was not yet public or linked on the main page.
